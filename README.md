Python assignment number one.	Make a simple dictionary application, which can save the dictionary in JSON format. The user can search words from the dictionary. If the word is found, it displays the translation. if the word is not found, the program displays "Word not found. Please input a definition". If user submits a definition, it adds a new word to this dictionary. There should be a way to exit the application e.g. input an empty string.

When the application is started it checks if the file containing the dictionary exists and will try to load the dictionary. If loading fails, it starts with an inbuilt default dictionary, which might contain just few words. The application must save the dictionary, including newly added words, when the user exits the application.
