Python assignment number one.

Make a simple dictionary application, which can save the dictionary in JSON format. The user can search words from the dictionary. If the word is found, it displays the translation. if the word is not found, the program displays "Word not found. Please input a definition". If user submits a definition, it adds a new word to this dictionary. There should be a way to exit the application e.g. input an empty string.

When the application is started it checks if the file containing the dictionary exists and will try to load the dictionary. If loading fails, it starts with an inbuilt default dictionary, which might contain just few words. The application must save the dictionary, including newly added words, when the user exits the application.

Python assignment number two

Make a program, which asks the user a string of integers, which can be separated by any character or characters (space, comma, semicolon etc.). The program will then calculate the sum, mean and median of the inputted values in 1-digit precision. E.g. valid input could be “1, 2, 3” and the sum would be 6, mean would be 2 and median would be 2. Or the valid input could be "123, -5 13;-1 and 10" and the sum would be 140, mean would be 28.0 and median would be 10.0.
