web programming assignments

Python assignment number one.

Make a simple dictionary application, which can save the dictionary in JSON format. The user can search words from the dictionary. If the word is found, it displays the translation. if the word is not found, the program displays "Word not found. Please input a definition". If user submits a definition, it adds a new word to this dictionary. There should be a way to exit the application e.g. input an empty string.

When the application is started it checks if the file containing the dictionary exists and will try to load the dictionary. If loading fails, it starts with an inbuilt default dictionary, which might contain just few words. The application must save the dictionary, including newly added words, when the user exits the application.

Python assignment number two

Make a program, which asks the user a string of integers, which can be separated by any character or characters (space, comma, semicolon etc.). The program will then calculate the sum, mean and median of the inputted values in 1-digit precision. E.g. valid input could be “1, 2, 3” and the sum would be 6, mean would be 2 and median would be 2. Or the valid input could be "123, -5 13;-1 and 10" and the sum would be 140, mean would be 28.0 and median would be 10.0.


Python assignment number three

Make a program, which asks URL from the user. If the URL can be opened, write the URL contents into a local file path defined by the user. Use binary mode and check that file writing succeeds. The program should not fail if given URL cannot be found.

Python assignment number six

Make a Python program, which can validate if the input string is a valid Finnish id number. You must calculate that the checksum is correct. Also output the birthdate of the person in format day.month.year and tell the gender (male/female) See https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henkil%C3%B6tunnus

Javascript assignment nine

Make a HTML5 web form which has the following input fields:
a. text (required)
b. radio (at least 3 different choices)
c. checkbox (at least 3 different choices)
d. email (required)
e. password (twice)
f. color
g. date
h. time
i. number (1 to 300) e.g. height in cm
j. range (from 0 to 100, stepping 5) e.g. price in euros
k. tel
l. url
m. <select> <option> with at least 3 choices e.g. country selection
n. textarea (using <textarea> of course)

Use descriptive labels for each input field and text area. Pressing "submit" button will validate that the input in both password fields are equal. The password must have 8...30 characters and can only contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and .,_-. If the input is valid, then submit button will simply write the input of ALL of the above fields into an output element called result.

Javascript assignment ten

Draw a stickman, which looks a bit like yourself using Canvas. Translate the center point of the stickman to origin (0,0). You must use different colors and a linear or radial gradient. Write your first name next to it using Canvas.

Animate the stickman, by rotating it around it around its center point. Background music is played. Both the animation and the music will start/pause pressing the play/pause button.

Javascript assignment eleven

Make a mobile optimized multiple-choice quiz using jQuery Mobile and radio button widgets. The quiz must have at least 3 questions and each question must have at least 3 different choices. Pressing “answer” button will calculate how many questions you got correct. The questions and their answers should be stored in JSON format.

Javascript assignment twelve

Use jQuery UI to make a web form, which has an autocomplete text input field, which will autocomplete all the EU countries (don't include non-EU countries). The same form should also have a date selector, which has week numbers visible, and a range selector for age, which limits choices between 0-140, 1-year stepping. The same form should also sortable list of at least 3 persons, both with thumbnail size photo + name. Their order can be rearranged dragging the person to the desired location.
